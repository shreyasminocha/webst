# Web’st

Web’st is a self-hostable, minimal frontend playground. Think JSFiddle, JSBin, or CodePen, except without the bells and whistles.

## Features

-   No analytics
-   No third-party requests
-   Minimal JavaScript

## Sacrifices

-   No fancy aesthetics
-   Little customizability
-   No syntax highlighting
-   No auto-matching of parantheses
-   No multi-cursors and other advanced keybindings

## Not for you?

If you need something that mimics the traditional IDE experience, look into [JSBin](https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin).
